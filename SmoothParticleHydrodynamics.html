  <h4 style="text-align: center"> <strong>Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics Simulation</strong></h4>
  <p> This is an implementation of an incompressible fluid dynamics simulation
    using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The basic approach is
    taken from the SPH Fluids in Computer Graphics paper written in 2014 by Ihmsen et al.
    I use this paper to calculate pressure and viscosity forces as well as handle
    boundary interactions. For the surface tension and Marching Cubes features
    of the simulation, I followed the approaches outlined in Versatile Surface
    Tension and Adhesion for SPH Fluids by Akinci et al. and Marching Cubes:
    A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm by Lorenson and Cline.
    </p>

  <h4> <strong>Implementing Boundary and Pressure Forces</strong></h4>
  <p> The first part of the simulation I implemented were the gravity and
      boundary forces. Once I was able to tune the boundary forces so that the
      particles did not fall out of the box, I slowly increased the pressure force
      until the particles were incompressible and did not slip through each other.

  <h4> <strong>Viscosity</strong></h4>
  <p> The next part of the simulation I implemented was the viscosity force.
      Here is a demonstration of a wave effect with one having much higher
      viscosity.

  <h4> <strong>Surface Tension</strong></h4>
  <p> In order to implement the surface tension I had to balance the pressure
      and viscosity forces so that they were about equal in strength to the
      surface tension force. I found that it was hard to reach this equilibrium
      as often times the surface tension force would be strong and cause the
      particles to compress too much and slip between each other. If the
      surface tension force was too weak then the pressure force would dominate
      and the particles would just fly away from each other without forming a
      sphere.

  <h4> <strong>Marching Cubes</strong></h4>
  <p> The Marching Cubes implementation was fairly straightforward. The following
    is a demo of the technique with a surface level value of 0.15. The video is sped
    up as the original simulation speed is very slow due to the limited performance
    of my computer at the time.

<h4><strong>Discussion</strong></h4>
<p>
  I was able to implement the features of the SPH paper (viscosity, pressure,
  boundaries) without much difficulty. However, I ran into many issues when
  implementing the surface tension feature. The surface tension works for the
  simulation but only at very particular values for stiffness constants and
  surface tension coefficients. If I were to expand on this project, I would like
  to investigate further into making the surface tension feature more robust.
  In order to do this I believe I would need to ensure greater physical accuracy
  in terms of units and measurements as the units for the current simulation are
  not entirely realistic and based off performance. For the Marching Cubes feature,
  I would also like to try running the simulation on a computer with better
  performance so I can use more cubes and render the particles on a finer grid.
