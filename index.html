  <h4 style="text-align: center"> <strong>Proposal: Homogeneous Volume Rendering for Subsurface Scattering</strong></h4>
  <p>For our project we plan to implement subsurface scattering through volumetric path tracing through a homogeneous volume. 
    As such, our project will be an extension of the path tracer to handle these new features. If there is time, then the path 
    tracer will be used to create a rendered image worthy for submission into a rendering competition. As volumetric rendering 
    requires entering tracing light rays through different media, transmission and full support for a BSDF are necessary. 
    Our BSDF implementation will follow the guidelines presented by the original GGX paper and will consist of our existing GGX 
    BRDF implementation, which we have been using for past homeworks, as well as an ideal BTDF implementation which we have written 
    specifically for this project. At each intersection, we will use the Fresnel term to probabilistically decide whether or not 
    we should sample according to the BRDF or BTDF. This will prevent our path tracer from growing at an exponential rate as otherwise 
    we would be shooting two rays at each intersection, one for reflection and one for refraction. With the addition of the BTDF we 
    will have effectively handled ray transmission and ray reflection thereby implementing a BSDF. Additionally we will model subsurface 
    scattering interactions by using volumetric rendering techniques whenever we enter an object. For these techniques we are following
    the closed tracking outline provided by the SIGGRAPH 2017 Course paper. We have rendered a variety of test
    images to show both our progress and final implementation.
    </p>
  
  <h4> <strong>Implementing the BTDF</strong></h5>
  <p> The first step in implementing our BSDF was to implement ray transmission through a material. To achieve this, 
    we implemented an ideal refraction BTDF in order to generate our refracted ray. For our scenes we defined materials as either
    transmissive or non-transmissive, with all transmissive materials subject to both refraction and reflection. This
    is opposed non-transmissive materials which only handled surface reflection. We used the Fresnel reflection coefficient for unpolarized light to decide
    between refraction and reflection at each intersection on a transmissive material. Direct lighting for transmissive materials is
    handled using either the ideal refraction BTDF or GGX BRDF at each boundary depending on if the ray refracts or reflects. In both cases we generate a sample and test to see if it hits any
    of the lights within the scene. If the sample intersects with the light and is not occuluded, we use the respective BTDF or BRDF
    in order to add radiance due to direct lighting. 
  </p>
  
  <p>Here is the Stanford Dragon with a transmissive material very similar to glass. We defined the indices of refraction for the
  dragon and the surrounding medium in the tester file. In this scene we use n=1.445 and n=1.00029 to represent glass and air. Notice 
  that the first dragon is rendered with direct light due to refraction and the second dragon is rendered without direct light due
    to refraction. The dragon without direct light has much stronger shadows due to total internal reflection compared to the direct light
    dragon which has much lighter shadows due to the direct lighting that it receives. The default dragon rendering using only a BRDF 
    is also included for reference. </p>

  <p>This is a Cornell Box scene we created with a single completely specular cube inside. The rendering of the cube with transmission
    resembles a perfectly clear window whereas the cube without transmission rerpresents a perfectly clear mirror. Besides the images
    produced on the faces of the cube being different, you can also see the difference in color at the base of the cubes. For the 
    non-transmissive cube, you can see the red and green light of the colored walls being reflected at the base. This is opposed to the 
    transmissive cube, which transmits nearly all light and does not have the reflected color at the base. </p>

  <p>This is a custom scene we made for this project. It involves the MIS scene from HW4, but with only one panel and a sphere in 
    the front. An interesting note is that when the maximum depth is configured to be 2, the sphere is actually very clear and represents
    the scene before noise comes in. This is because light must pass through the glass sphere before reaching the rest of the scene, essentially
    providing a window to view the scene behind it but with one less bounce of light.

   <h4> <strong>Implementing Volumetric Rendering</strong></h5>
   <p> The second step to implementing our BSDF was to implement a closed-path tracking solution to the volume rendering equation
     with reference from <em>Production Volume Rendering SIGGRAPH 2017 Course</em> by Fong <em>et al</em>. We limit our implementation to homogeneous
     volumes, allowing us to use a normalized version of the Beer-Lambert law as a free-flight estimator.
     At each intersection we apply a Russian Roulette based approach where we probabilistically sample
     between an emission event and an in-scattering based event. To deal with out-scattering and 
     absorption, we reduced the throughput using the Beer-Lambert Law and the distance traveled between subsequent collision events.
     For in-scattering, we used the Henyey-Greenstein phase function to modulate the distribution of likely incident
     light directions. As the phase function is also defined as a probability distribution, we can assume perfect importance
     sampling (the phase function output with respect to the angle between the incident and outgoing radiance directions is equal to
     its respective probability density function). Example scenes are given below.

  <p>Here are two photos of the Stanford dragon with g = -1 and g = 1 to represent backwards and forwards scattering. The dragon with
  backwards scattering has a light more light which reaches the camera. The absorption coefficient is 0.1 and the scattering 
  coefficient is 0.9 for both renderings. </p>

  <img src="btdf_dragon_scattering_forward.PNG" alt="Forwards Scattering">
 
  <p>These three photos of the Stanford dragon all use the isotropic phase function and have equal chance of scattering and absorption.
    The absorption and scattering coefficients are both 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 for each photo respectively. These photos also show the 
    effects of the isotropic phase function as the scattering within the medium with the speckles on the draogn representing
  pixels where scattering events occurred. Since the isotropic phase function randomly selects a direction, there is a random chance
  that we will pick up radiance from some other surface resulting in these lighter speckles within the dragon.</p>
